# hello-world
The start of my career change.

Jhai here, 29 years old, a public servant eyeing for a career change.
Thanks to this pandemic, I realize something that I have been taking for granted for a long time - family.
The months being in a Work-From-Home set-up makes me realize that the memories shared with te people dear to you matters most.
This is for them and to the memories yet to be folded.
